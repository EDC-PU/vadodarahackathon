# Team Join Flow Test Plan

## Fixed Issues
1. **Loop Prevention**: Added `justCompletedJoin` flag to prevent infinite redirect loops
2. **State Management**: Added `processingJoin` and `joinCompleted` states to track join process
3. **Session Storage**: Proper cleanup of session storage tokens

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Logged-in user with complete profile
1. User clicks join link `/join/HmayRKwYaIslnNsbpnHO`
2. User is already logged in with complete profile
3. User should be immediately added to team and redirected to `/member`

### Scenario 2: Logged-in user with incomplete profile
1. User clicks join link
2. User is logged in but profile is incomplete (missing enrollment number)
3. User should be redirected to `/complete-profile` with invite token stored
4. After completing profile, user should join team and be redirected to `/member`
5. Should NOT loop back to join page

### Scenario 3: Not logged in user
1. User clicks join link
2. User sees signup form with team invitation context
3. After signup, user should complete profile and join team
4. Should be redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Scenario 4: User already on a team
1. User clicks join link
2. User is already on another team
3. Should see error message "You are already on a team"

## Key Changes Made

### `src/app/join/[token]/page.tsx`
- Added `justCompletedJoin` flag check to prevent loops
- Added `processingJoin` and `joinCompleted` state tracking
- Improved useEffect dependencies to prevent multiple executions
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

### `src/components/complete-profile-form.tsx`
- Added `justCompletedJoin` flag setting after successful team join
- Ensured proper session storage cleanup

### `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
- Already had join page exception handling for incomplete profiles
- No changes needed for redirect logic

## Expected Behavior
- No infinite redirect loops
- Smooth transition from join → profile completion → team membership → dashboard
- Proper error handling for invalid invites and team full scenarios
- Clean session storage management
