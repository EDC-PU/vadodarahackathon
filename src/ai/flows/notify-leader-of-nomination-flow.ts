Dear ${leaderName},

Congratulations on being nominated for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 from the Institute level! ðŸŽ‰ This is a proud moment and a great opportunity to showcase your teamâ€™s innovation on a national platform.

As part of the next step, all nominated team leaders are requested to choose a mentor who will accompany your team during the SIH 2025 offline rounds. Please note the following important points:

- If your team is shortlisted by the SIH Screening Committee, you will be required to travel to the respective SIH center, which can be anywhere across India.
- The mentorâ€™s presence with the team is mandatory at the allotted center.

Hence, kindly select your mentor thoughtfully and ensure they will be available to travel with the team if required.

Once you have finalized your mentor, please nominate them through your Vadodara Hackathon 6.0 Portal (Leader Login).

Portal Link: https://vadodarahackathon.pierc.org/leader

We wish you and your team the very best for the upcoming stages of SIH 2025. May this journey bring you great learning and success!

Regards,
Vadodara Hackathon Team
